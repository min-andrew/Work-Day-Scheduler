# Work-Day-Scheduler

Helped build out a work-day scheduler application.

## Description

With the source code, we built an application that allows someone to schedule their day based on the hours of a workday. Some other features include telling you what date it is, as well as keeping track of what hour it is through color. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Windows 10 or the latest Mac OS.

## Help

Note: this layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px.
